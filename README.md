# partyManager

Goal: Just practicing my Java

Simple party stat tracking app for D&D 4th ed.

Eventually I want to include:  
-Combat turn tracking (input initiatives, tells us who is next in the round)  
-Automatic hit detection + damage application (input atk roll + atk type, auto check against player defense and apply damage)  
-Encounter enemy stat tracking  
-Encounter enemy auto hit detection + damage application  
-Player spell usage tracking (my friends cheat a lot)  

-Mobile support?
