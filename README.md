# partyManager

Goal: Just practicing my Java

Simple party stat tracking app for D&D 4th ed.

Eventually I want to include:  
-Loot distribution  
-Item stats  
-Player spell usage tracking (my friends cheat a lot)  

-Mobile support?  

As a DM, combat encounters are the most boring part of D&D because they take forever. I want to enable my group to play faster!
